# Data Analysis Using Pandas

## Overview
This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the use of Pandas for data analysis across different datasets. Each notebook focuses on unique aspects of data manipulation, ranging from basic operations to advanced data integration techniques. They are intended as a learning tool for Python data analysis and as a reference for building similar data analysis projects. They provide clear examples of how to apply various Pandas functionalities in real-world scenarios.

## Features
- **Notebook 1: Elections** - Demonstrates basic data loading, DataFrame operations, filtering techniques, and utility functions.
- **Notebook 2: Baby Names** - Focuses on importing and manipulating a dataset of baby names, with complex sorting and aggregation.
- **Notebook 3: Data Integration** - Explores advanced grouping, multi-column operations, pivot tables, and merging the `elections` and `baby names` datasets.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to local machine.
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell sequentially to observe the data manipulation process.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- NumPy library
- Matplotlib library (for plotting)
- Plotly library (for interactive visualizations)

## Input
Each notebook processes various CSV files containing relevant datasets:
- **Elections:** A dataset on electoral results over multiple years.
- **Baby Names:** A dataset of baby names provided annually by the SSA.
- **Data Integration:** Combines both previous datasets to perform integrated data analysis.

## Output
The notebooks output various processed forms of the input data, including summaries, visualizations, and results of data manipulations that demonstrate the capabilities of Pandas.

## Notes
- Ensure that all prerequisites are installed before running the notebooks.
- Paths to data files are set relative to the notebook's directory. Ensure that data files are located as specified or adjust the paths accordingly.
